{#
  Lamdas allow us to pass fuctions and classes as
  parameters to other fuctions and classes and call
  them when needed

  Just like normal functions lamda functions can use
  current objects, theres no reasoj for it but you can
  do it
#}
fun math(fn: {(Int, Int) -> Int}, b: Int) {
  {# Call the lamda function #}
  fn(b, 3)
